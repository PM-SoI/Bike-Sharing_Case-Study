## General Information:
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## Problem Statement: 
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is looking for possible solution for increasing the revenues after the lockdown period.To predict the user demand for shared bikes among the people after the Covid-19 and make huge profits, they have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes. 
- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

- The company wants to know:
•	Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
•	How well those variables describe the bike demands?
•   To create a linear model that predicts the user demand.

## Project Methodology: 
1. Data Understanding: Reading & Understanding the dataset
2. Visualising the data: Uni/Bi/Multi-variate Analysis, Numeric & Categorical visualization etc.
3. Data Preparation
4. Data Splitting (with Scaling as applicable) in Train & Test.
5. Model Building: Multiple Linear Regression
6. Feature Selection using VIF and p-values.
7. Residual Analysis of the Model output.
8. Model Evaluation for interpretability and accuracy.

## Conclusions
- Total Registered Bike Users are predicted using Model-1.
- Total Casual Bike Users are predicted using Model-2.
- Total Bike Users are calculated by adding the Registered and Casual users.

## Technologies Used
- Python IDE was used for coding and implementing the ML models.
